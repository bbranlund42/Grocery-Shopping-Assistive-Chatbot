                Hello! How can I assist you today?
               How are you today
Second Response: I'm doing well, thanks for asking!
                 I'm a large language model, so I don't have feelings or emotions like humans do,
                 but I'm always happy to chat and help with any questions or topics you'd like to discuss.
                 How about you? How's your day going so far?

We can format what we send to the fastapp.py in the frontend since we will already have the history.
Or we can trim everything off and just send the current response
